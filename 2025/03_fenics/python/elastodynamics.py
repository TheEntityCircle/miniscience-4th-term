# Time-integration of elastodynamics equation
# ============================================
#
# This demo is implemented in a single Python file,
# :download:`demo_elastodynamics.py`, which contains both the
# variational forms and the solver.
#
# This demo shows how to perform time integration of transient elastodynamics using the generalized-:math:`\alpha` method [ERL2002]_. In particular it demonstrates how to:
#
# * formulate mass and damping forms of the elastodynamics equation
# * implement the generalized-:math:`\alpha` method and its influence on the solution
# * perform efficient computation of stresses using ``LocalSolver``
#
# The deformed structure evolution over time along with the axial stress will look as follows:

# -----------------------------------------
# Introduction and elastodynamics equation
# -----------------------------------------
#
# The elastodynamics equation combine the balance of linear momentum:
#
# .. math::
#    \nabla \cdot \sigma + \rho b = \rho \ddot{u}
#
# where :math:`u` is the displacement vector field, :math:`\ddot{u}=\partial^2 u/\partial t^2` is the acceleration,
# :math:`\rho` the material density, :math:`b` a given body force and :math:`\sigma` the stress tensor which is related
# to the displacement through a constitutive equation. In the case of isotropic linearized elasticity, one has:
#
# .. math::
#    \sigma =\lambda \text{tr}(\varepsilon)\mathbb{1} + 2\mu\varepsilon
#
# where :math:`\varepsilon = (\nabla u + (\nabla u)^T)/2` is the linearized strain tensor, :math:`\mathbb{1}` is the
# identity of second-rank tensors and :math:`\lambda=\dfrac{E\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)},\mu=\dfrac{E}{2(1+\nu)}` are the
# Lame coefficients given as functions of the Young modulus :math:`E` and the Poisson ratio :math:`\nu`.
#
# The weak form is readily obtained by integrating by part the balance equation using a test function :math:`v\in V`
# with :math:`V` being a suitable function space that satisfies the displacement boundary conditions:
#
# .. math::
#    \int_{\Omega} \rho \ddot{u}\cdot v \, {\rm d} x + \int_{\Omega} \sigma(u):\varepsilon(v) \, {\rm d} x =
#    \int_{\Omega} \rho b \cdot v  \, {\rm d} x + \int_{\partial\Omega} (\sigma\cdot n) \cdot v \, {\rm d} s \quad \text{for all } v\in V
#
# The previous equation can be written as follows:
#
# .. math::
#    \text{Find }u\in V\text{ such that } m(\ddot{u},v) + k(u,v) = L(v) \quad \text{for all } v\in V
#
# where :math:`m` is the symmetric bilinear form associated with the mass matrix and :math:`k` the one associated with the stiffness matrix.
#
# After introducing the finite element space interpolation, one obtains the corresponding discretized evolution equation:
#
# .. math::
#    \text{Find }\{u\}\in\mathbb{R}^n\text{ such that } \{v\}^T[M]\{\ddot{u}\} + \{v\}^T[K]\{u\} = \{v\}^T\{F\} \quad \text{for all } \{v\}\in\mathbb{R}^n
#
# which is a generalized :math:`n`-dof harmonic oscillator equation.
#
# Quite often in structural dynamics, structures do not oscillate perfectly but lose energy through various dissipative mechanisms (friction with air or supports,
# internal dissipation through plasticity, damage, etc.). Dissipative terms can be introduced at the level of the constitutive equation if these mechanisms are well
# known but quite often it is not the case. Dissipation can then be modeled by adding an *ad hoc* damping term depending on the structure velocity :math:`\dot{u}`
# to the previous evolution equation:
#
# .. math::
#    \text{Find }u\in V\text{ such that } m(\ddot{u},v) + c(\dot{u},v) + k(u,v) = L(v) \quad \text{for all } v\in V
#
# The damping form will be considered here as bilinear and symmetric, being therefore associated with a damping matrix :math:`[C]`.
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Rayleigh damping
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# When little is known about the origin of damping in the structure, a popular choice for the damping matrix, known as *Rayleigh damping*, consists in using
# a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrix :math:`[C] = \eta_M[M]+\eta_K[K]` with two positive parameters :math:`\eta_M,\eta_K` which
# can be fitted against experimental measures for instance (usually by measuring the damping ratio of two natural modes of vibration).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Time discretization using the generalized-:math:`\alpha` method
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# We now introduce a time discretization of the interval study :math:`[0;T]` in :math:`N+1` time increments :math:`t_0=0,t_1,\ldots,t_N,t_{N+1}=T`
# with :math:`\Delta t=T/N` denoting the time step (supposed constant). The resolution will make use of the generalized-:math:`\alpha` method
# which can be seen as an extension of the widely used Newmark-:math:`\beta` method in structural dynamics. As an implicit method, it is unconditionally
# stable for a proper choice of coefficients so that quite large time steps can be used. It also allows for high frequency dissipation and offers a
# second-order accuracy, i.e. in :math:`O(\Delta t^2)`.
#
# The method consists in solving the dynamic evolution equation at intermediate time between :math:`t_n` and :math:`t_{n+1}` as follows:
#
# .. math::
#    [M]\{\ddot{u}_{n+1-\alpha_m}\} + [C]\{\dot{u}_{n+1-\alpha_f}\}+[K]\{u_{n+1-\alpha_f}\} = \{F(t_{n+1-\alpha_f})\}
#
# with the notation :math:`X_{n+1-\alpha} = (1-\alpha)X_{n+1}+\alpha X_{n}`. In addition, the following approximation for the displacement and velocity
# at :math:`t_{n+1}` are used:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{align*}
#    \{u_{n+1}\} &= \{u_{n}\}+\Delta t \{\dot{u}_{n}\} + \dfrac{\Delta t^2}{2}\left((1-2\beta)\{\ddot{u}_{n}\}+2\beta\{\ddot{u}_{n+1}\}\right) \\
#    \{\dot{u}_{n+1}\} &= \{\dot{u}_{n}\} + \Delta t\left((1-\gamma)\{\ddot{u}_{n}\}+\gamma\{\ddot{u}_{n+1}\}\right)
#    \end{align*}
#
# It can be seen that these are the relations of the Newmark method. The latter is therefore obtained as a particular case when :math:`\alpha_f=\alpha_m=0`.
#
# The problem can then be formulated in terms of unkown displacement at :math:`t_{n+1}` with:
#
# .. math::
#    \{\ddot{u}_{n+1}\} = \dfrac{1}{\beta\Delta t^2}\left(\{u_{n+1}\} - \{u_{n}\}-\Delta t \{\dot{u}_{n}\} \right) - \dfrac{1-2\beta}{2\beta}\{\ddot{u}_{n}\}
#
# After plugging into the evolution and rearranging the known and unknown terms, one obtains the following system to solve:
#
# .. math::
#    \begin{align*}
#    [\bar{K}]\{u_{n+1}\} &= \{F(t_{n+1-\alpha_f})\} - \alpha_f[K]\{u_n\} \\
#         &- [C](c_1\{u_n\}+c_2\{\dot{u}_n\}+c_3\{\ddot{u}_n\})-[M](m_1\{u_n\}+m_2\{\dot{u}_n\}+m_3\{\ddot{u}_n\})
#  \end{align*}
#
# where:
#  * :math:`[\bar{K}] = [K]+c_1[C]+m_1[M]`
#  * :math:`c_1 = \dfrac{\gamma(1-\alpha_f)}{\beta\Delta t}`
#  * :math:`c_2 = 1-\gamma(1-\alpha_f)/\beta`
#  * :math:`c_3 = \Delta t(1-\alpha_f)(1-\dfrac{\gamma}{2\beta})`
#  * :math:`m_1 = \dfrac{(1-\alpha_m)}{\beta\Delta t^2}`
#  * :math:`m_2 = \dfrac{(1-\alpha_m)}{\beta\Delta t}`
#  * :math:`m_3 = 1-\dfrac{1-\alpha_m}{2\beta}`
#
# Once the linear system has been solved for :math:`\{u_{n+1}\}`, the new velocity and acceleration are computed using the previous formulae.
#
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Popular choice of parameters
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The most popular choice for the parameters is: :math:`\alpha_m,\alpha_f \leq 1/2` and :math:`\gamma=\dfrac{1}{2}+\alpha_m-\alpha_f`,
# :math:`\beta=\dfrac{1}{4}\left(\gamma+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2` which ensures unconditional stability, optimal dissipation and second-order accuracy.
#
#
# ---------------
# Implementation
# ---------------
#
# We consider a rectangular beam clamped at one end and loaded by a uniform vertical traction at the other end.
# After importing the relevant modules, the mesh and subdomains for boundary conditions are defined::

from dolfin import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Form compiler options
parameters["form_compiler"]["cpp_optimize"] = True
parameters["form_compiler"]["optimize"] = True

# Define mesh
mesh = BoxMesh(Point(0., 0., 0.), Point(1., 0.1, 0.04), 60, 10, 5)

# Sub domain for clamp at left end
def left(x, on_boundary):
    return near(x[0], 0.) and on_boundary

# Sub domain for rotation at right end
def right(x, on_boundary):
    return near(x[0], 1.) and on_boundary


# Material parameters for the elastic constitutive relation, the material density :math:`\rho`
# for the mass matrix and the two parameters defining the Rayleigh damping :math:`\eta_M,\eta_K`
# (initially zero damping is considered but this value can be changed) are now defined::

# Elastic parameters
E  = 1000.0
nu = 0.3
mu    = Constant(E / (2.0*(1.0 + nu)))
lmbda = Constant(E*nu / ((1.0 + nu)*(1.0 - 2.0*nu)))

# Mass density
rho = Constant(1.0)

# Rayleigh damping coefficients
eta_m = Constant(0.)
eta_k = Constant(0.)

# Parameters used for the time discretization scheme are now defined. First, the four parameters used by the
# generalized-:math:`\alpha` method are chosen. Here, we used the optimal dissipation and second-order accuracy
# choice for :math:`\beta` and :math:`\gamma`, namely :math:`\beta=\dfrac{1}{4}\left(\gamma+\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2` and
# :math:`\gamma=\dfrac{1}{2}+\alpha_m-\alpha_f` with :math:`\alpha_m=0.2` and :math:`\alpha_f=0.4` ensuring unconditional stability::

# Generalized-alpha method parameters
alpha_m = Constant(0.2)
alpha_f = Constant(0.4)
gamma   = Constant(0.5+alpha_f-alpha_m)
beta    = Constant((gamma+0.5)**2/4.)

# We also define the final time of the interval, the number of time steps and compute the associated time interval
# between two steps::

# Time-stepping parameters
T       = 4.0
Nsteps  = 50
dt = Constant(T/Nsteps)


# We now define the time-dependent loading. Body forces are zero and the imposed loading consists of a uniform vertical traction
# applied at the ``right`` extremity. The loading amplitude will vary linearly from :math:`0` to :math:`p_0=1` over the time interval
# :math:`[0;T_c=T/5]`, after :math:`T_c` the loading is removed. For this purpose, we used the following JIT-compiled ``Expression``.
# In particular, it uses a conditional syntax using operators ``?`` and ``:`` ::

p0 = 1.
cutoff_Tc = T/5
# Define the loading as an expression depending on t
p = Expression(("0", "t <= tc ? p0*t/tc : 0", "0"), t=0, tc=cutoff_Tc, p0=p0, degree=0)

# A standard vectorial :math:`P^1` FunctionSpace is now defined for the displacement, velocity and acceleration fields. We also
# define a tensorial DG-0 FunctionSpace for saving the stress field evolution::

# Define function space for displacement, velocity and acceleration
V = VectorFunctionSpace(mesh, "CG", 1)
# Define function space for stresses
Vsig = TensorFunctionSpace(mesh, "DG", 0)

# Test and trial functions are defined and the unkown displacement (corresponding to :math:`\{u_{n+1}\}` for the current time step)
# will be represented by the Function ``u``. Displacement, velocity and acceleration fields of the previous increment
# :math:`t_n` will respectively be represented by functions ``u_old``, ``v_old`` and ``a_old``::

# Test and trial functions
du = TrialFunction(V)
u_ = TestFunction(V)
# Current (unknown) displacement
u = Function(V, name="Displacement")
# Fields from previous time step (displacement, velocity, acceleration)
u_old = Function(V)
v_old = Function(V)
a_old = Function(V)

# We now use a ``MeshFunction`` for distinguishing the different boundaries and mark the right extremity using an ``AutoSubDomain``.
# The exterior surface measure ``ds`` is then defined using the boundary subdomains. Simple Dirichlet boundary conditions are also defined at the left extremity::

# Create mesh function over the cell facets
boundary_subdomains = MeshFunction("size_t", mesh, mesh.topology().dim() - 1)
boundary_subdomains.set_all(0)
force_boundary = AutoSubDomain(right)
force_boundary.mark(boundary_subdomains, 3)

# Define measure for boundary condition integral
dss = ds(subdomain_data=boundary_subdomains)

# Set up boundary condition at left end
zero = Constant((0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
bc = DirichletBC(V, zero, left)

# Python functions are now defined to obtain the elastic stress tensor :math:`\sigma` (linear isotropic elasticity), the bilinear mass and stiffness forms as well
# as the damping form obtained as a linear combination of the mass and stiffness forms (Rayleigh damping). The linear form corresponding to the work of external forces is also defined::

# Stress tensor
def sigma(r):
    return 2.0*mu*sym(grad(r)) + lmbda*tr(sym(grad(r)))*Identity(len(r))

# Mass form
def m(u, u_):
    return rho*inner(u, u_)*dx

# Elastic stiffness form
def k(u, u_):
    return inner(sigma(u), sym(grad(u_)))*dx

# Rayleigh damping form
def c(u, u_):
    return eta_m*m(u, u_) + eta_k*k(u, u_)

# Work of external forces
def Wext(u_):
    return dot(u_, p)*dss(3)

# Functions for implementing the time stepping scheme are also defined. ``update_a`` returns :math:`\{\ddot{u}_{n+1}\}`
# as a function of the variables at the previous increment and of the new displacement :math:`\{u_{n+1}\}`. The function accepts a keyword ``ufl`` so that the expressions involved can be used with UFL representations if ``True`` or with array of values if ``False`` (we will make use of both possibilities later).
# In particular, the time step ``dt`` and time-stepping scheme parameters are either ``Constant`` or floats depending on the case.
# Function ``update_v`` does the same but for the new velocity :math:`\{\dot{u}_{n+1}\}` as a function of the previous variables
# and of the new acceleration. Finally, function ``update_fields`` performs the final update at the end of the time step when the new
# displacement :math:`\{u_{n+1}\}` has effectively been computed. In this context, the new acceleration and velocities are computed
# using the vector representation of the different fields. The variables keeping track of the values at the previous increment are now assigned the new values computed for the current increment::

# Update formula for acceleration
# a = 1/(2*beta)*((u - u0 - v0*dt)/(0.5*dt*dt) - (1-2*beta)*a0)
def update_a(u, u_old, v_old, a_old, ufl=True):
    if ufl:
        dt_ = dt
        beta_ = beta
    else:
        dt_ = float(dt)
        beta_ = float(beta)
    return (u-u_old-dt_*v_old)/beta_/dt_**2 - (1-2*beta_)/2/beta_*a_old

# Update formula for velocity
# v = dt * ((1-gamma)*a0 + gamma*a) + v0
def update_v(a, u_old, v_old, a_old, ufl=True):
    if ufl:
        dt_ = dt
        gamma_ = gamma
    else:
        dt_ = float(dt)
        gamma_ = float(gamma)
    return v_old + dt_*((1-gamma_)*a_old + gamma_*a)

def update_fields(u, u_old, v_old, a_old):
    """Update fields at the end of each time step."""

    # Get vectors (references)
    u_vec, u0_vec  = u.vector(), u_old.vector()
    v0_vec, a0_vec = v_old.vector(), a_old.vector()

    # use update functions using vector arguments
    a_vec = update_a(u_vec, u0_vec, v0_vec, a0_vec, ufl=False)
    v_vec = update_v(a_vec, u0_vec, v0_vec, a0_vec, ufl=False)

    # Update (u_old <- u)
    v_old.vector()[:], a_old.vector()[:] = v_vec, a_vec
    u_old.vector()[:] = u.vector()

# The system variational form is now built by expressing the new acceleration :math:`\{\ddot{u}_{n+1}\}` as a function of
# the TrialFunction ``du`` using ``update_a``, which here works as a UFL expression. Using this new acceleration, the same is
# done for the new velocity using ``update_v``. Intermediate averages using parameters :math:`\alpha_m,\alpha_f` of the generalized- :math:`\alpha`
# method are obtained with a user-defined fuction ``avg``. The weak form evolution equation is then written using all these
# quantities. Since the problem is linear, we then extract the bilinear and linear parts using ``rhs`` and ``lhs``::

def avg(x_old, x_new, alpha):
    return alpha*x_old + (1-alpha)*x_new

# Residual
a_new = update_a(du, u_old, v_old, a_old, ufl=True)
v_new = update_v(a_new, u_old, v_old, a_old, ufl=True)
res = m(avg(a_old, a_new, alpha_m), u_) + c(avg(v_old, v_new, alpha_f), u_) \
       + k(avg(u_old, du, alpha_f), u_) - Wext(u_)
a_form = lhs(res)
L_form = rhs(res)

# Alternatively, the use of ``derivative`` can be made for non-linear problems for instance or one can also directly
# formulate the system to solve, involving the modified stiffness matrix :math:`[\bar{K}]` and the various coefficients introduced earlier.
#
# Since the system matrix to solve is the same for each time step (constant time step), it is not necessary to factorize the system at each increment.
# It can be done once and for all and only perform assembly of the varying right-hand side and backsubstitution to obtain the solution
# much more efficiently. This is done by defining a ``LUSolver`` object and asking for reusing the matrix factorization::

# Define solver for reusing factorization
K, res = assemble_system(a_form, L_form, bc)
solver = LUSolver(K, "petsc")
solver.parameters["symmetric"] = True

# We now initiate the time stepping loop. We will keep track of the beam vertical tip displacement over time as well as the different
# parts of the system total energy. We will also compute the stress field and save it, along with the displacement field, in a ``XDMFFile``.
# The option `flush_ouput` enables to open the result file before the loop is finished, the ``function_share_mesh`` option tells that only one
# mesh is used for all functions of a given time step (displacement and stress) while the ``rewrite_function_mesh`` enforces that the same mesh
# is used for all time steps. These two options enables writing the mesh information only once instead of :math:`2N_{steps}` times::

# Time-stepping
time = np.linspace(0, T, Nsteps+1)
u_tip = np.zeros((Nsteps+1,))
energies = np.zeros((Nsteps+1, 4))

#xdmf_file.parameters["flush_output"] = True
#xdmf_file.parameters["functions_share_mesh"] = True
#xdmf_file.parameters["rewrite_function_mesh"] = False

# The time loop is now started, the loading is first evaluated at :math:`t=t_{n+1-\alpha_f}`. The corresponding system right-hand side is then
# assembled and the system is solved. The different fields are then updated with the newly computed quantities. Finally, some post-processing is
# performed: stresses are computed and written to the result file and the tip displacement and the different energies are recorded::

# Note that in the above, the stresses are computed using a ``LocalSolver`` through the ``local_project`` function. Since the stress function space
# is a DG-0 space, the projection on this space can be performed element-wise in a very efficient manner. We therefore take advantage of the ``LocalSolver``
# functionality which is precisely dedicated to such situations. Since this projection is performed at each time step, the savings in terms of computing
# time can be quite important.
#
# As regards the computation of the various energies, the elastic and kinetic energies are respectively given by:
#
# .. math::
#    E_{elas} = \int_{\Omega} \dfrac{1}{2}\sigma(u):\varepsilon(u) \, {\rm d} x
# .. math::
#    E_{kin} = \int_{\Omega} \dfrac{1}{2}\rho \dot{u}\cdot\dot{u} \, {\rm d} x
#
# which are readily computed from the respective stiffness and mass forms ``k`` and ``m`` and the current displacement and velocity. The energy related to damping
# is computed from the corresponding dissipation term :math:`\mathcal{D}=c(\dot{u},\dot{u})` and integrated over time:
#
# .. math::
#    E_{damp} = \int_0^T \mathcal{D} \, {\rm d} t
#
# As for the work developed by the external forces, the contribution to the energy is added at each time step. Finally, the total energy of the sytem is given by:
#
# .. math::
#    E_{tot} = E_{elas}+E_{kin}+E_{damp}-E_{ext}
#
# When the time evolution loop is finished, the evolution of the tip displacement as well as the different contributions of the energy are plotted as functions of time::

# Plot tip displacement evolution

# Analyzing the results
# ---------------------
#
# We first consider the case of zero Rayleigh damping :math:`\eta_M=\eta_K=0`. In this case, it can be observed that the evolution of the total energy depends
# on the choice of the time-stepping scheme parameters. With :math:`\alpha_m=\alpha_f=0`, we recover the Newmark-:math:`\beta` method with :math:`\beta=0.25,\gamma=0.5`.
# This scheme is known for being conservative. This can be observed (figure-left) in the constant total energy for :math:`t\geq T_c` when the loading is removed. On the contrary,
# for non zero alpha parameters, e.g. :math:`\alpha_m=0.2, \alpha_f=0.4`, it can be observed (figure-right) that the energy is decreasing during this phase, indicating numerical damping.
# For both cases, the scheme is unconditionally stable. Moreover, these differences vanish when reducing the time step.
